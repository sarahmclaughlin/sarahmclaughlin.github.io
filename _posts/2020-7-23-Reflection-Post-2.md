**What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?**  
In my first blog post, I said that a data scientist "is a person who uses programming and knowledge of mathematics and statistics to answer qeustions and solve problems". They need to "have a sound understanding ... to pick the best model for a data set". I still agree with this description; however, I believe a data scientist does a lot more programming than a statistician. Through this course, I have a stronger understanding of how to code something (a model, for example) but less of an understanding of how to make a good/better model. This would be where the statistician comes in. You need to know more than simply coding. A data scientist will primarily code and can get pretty far without a statistician; to fully answer the question, or solve the problem, you will need both.  

**What are your current thoughts in terms of using R for data science: Do you think you'll continue to use R going forward? Why or why not?**  
I am much more comfortable with R now and I do believe I will be using it in the future. It is fast, clean, and fairly user friendly. I hope to be able to do more with RShiny, as that is a great resource! My one big frustration is the wealth of knowledge that is out there in R. It is overwhelming! I dislike the fact that there is more than one way to do something and often times, googling an issue can lead to more headache. I still prefer SAS because of its straightforward and singular way to code. This course, however, has strengthened my ability to code in R (and by extension, SAS). I am better at reading code and thinking in the systematic way that coding requires. If I got a job in data science, I do think I would be prepared to code in either language (with more experience, of course!).  While difficult, I am also thankful for the brief experience with docker containers. I am sure I will appreciate having had that exposure when I begin working in the data world.  

**What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?**  
Again, this course has strengthened my ability to code. As I have begun to do with my RShiny Project, I have mapped out exactly what it is that I want to code and move on from there. It has helped me as I begin to code. It is helpful to know the bigger picture and what needs to be done to get there. I hoep to continue to do that in the future, especially if I move into the data world. Clients will be specific in what they want, and I need to be able to meet those expectations.  

Overall, coding is difficult (especially at the beginning) but when it works, it is such fun! It'll be nice one day to have such a mastery of coding that it is like second nature to me! But, that takes practice.
