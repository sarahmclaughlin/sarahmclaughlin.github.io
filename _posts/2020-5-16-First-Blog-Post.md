What do you think being a data scientist is about?  

A data scientist is a person who can use computer science, and knowledge of mathematics and statistics to answer questions and solve problems. Typically, this involves knowledge of programming to work with large data sets. Knowledge of mathematics and statistics is needed as well to use the large data sets to answer questions and solve problems. 

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  

Major duties include working and manipulating large sets of data via programming. Data scientists should also have a sound understanding of mathematics and statistics to pick the best model or machine learning type is best for the specific data set. This should assist the data scientist in being able to perform analysis. 

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  

Data scientists and statisticians do perhaps the same thing but on different scales. Both data scientists and statisticians need to be able to take data, run analysis, and procure conclusions. Statisticians do so on smaller data sets while data scientists do so on large ones. Statisticians need deeper and more theoretical knowledge. Data scientists need a more general knowledge of statistics. Statisticians may answer the question: “How can this particular model be improved?” while data scientists answer the question: “Which model is best for this data?” 

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

This is a great question! I think I am leaning more towards being a data scientist; another option would be to teach statistics at a high school or community college. (I recently just finished my fourth year teaching!) I have no desire to get a PhD in Statistics. The deeper and more theoretical knowledge is more difficult for me to wrap my head around. I enjoy programming a lot and the thought of not using that skill after I finish this program saddens me. I believe being a data scientist would allow me to keep that skill.
