**How is the course going so far?**  
So far, I have enjoyed the class, but I have to admit that it has increased in difficulty and intensity in the past few weeks. I am a little worried about the rest of the course but I am pleased with my performance thus far. I had difficulty parallel computing and am not sure I put my best foot forward in the first project. I did very well on the first exam; I tend to test well and have not received Project 1 back yet. The pace is fast (which is to be expected in a summer course) but I am concerned that I would have been better off learning this material during a typical 15 week course. We will see how the rest of the course goes! I worry that it moves so fast that I retain little or only have a base understanding of the content. I am similar feelings with ST555 that I took last summer.   

**What do you like about the course and what would you change about the course?**  
I am learning A LOT of new stuff that I did not know before AND am gaining a lot of experience with R. The beginning seemed so easy, and I would have much preferred to front load the easier content at the beginning to have more time to spend on the more complex topics. It seems like we have so much due in such a short amount of time and because the concepts are more complex, it is taking me a longer time to complete the assignments and projects. I would also appreciate more examples of code, even if not covered in the lectures, for reference.  

**Other thoughts?**  
I am nervous about the rest of the course. However, I typically feel this way during a class and I typically come out on top and am proud of myself for pushing through. So I am cautiously optimistic!
