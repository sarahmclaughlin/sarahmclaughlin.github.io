**What are your thoughts on R vs. whatever other software you've used?**  
Besides R, I have quite a bit of experience with SAS. I have taken both ST555 and ST556, which really provided me with a strong foundation in SAS programming. As of right now, I prefer SAS but mostly due to the fact that I have more experience with it. SAS is more familiar to me than R; I took this class to gain more confidence with R. ST555 gave me a love for programming which led me to take this course, as well!  

**What functionality do you like about R?**  
R is fast, more user friendly and intuitive than SAS. I appreciate the ability to tab to autocomplete code, the environment where variables, datasets, functions, etc. are stored, and the overall look of R. To be honest, R is just "prettier looking" than SAS. SAS was created in the 1960s and the design seems to haven't changed since. Learning code chaining was revolutionary for me. What a great programming tool! There is also a wealth of knowledge available for R, and it seems to be ubiquitous in the statistics programming world.  

**What parts do you miss about your other language?**  
Aside from familiarity, I feel like I know more about how SAS operates than R. Things like the word scanner, compiler, Input Buffer, PDV, etc. I am still confused as to how R reads and processes code. In the last lecture, it was mentioned that `<-` takes precedence over `=` and that was strange to me. Shouldn't R just read from left to right like SAS? In ST556, I learned about macros and found that super helpful for quick, changeable, and usable coding. We also learned SQL, which I would assume can also be done with R. I also appreciate how thorough SAS is in its functions and packages. The SAS help pages are well curated and I can be confident that I am getting the correct solution.   

**Do you consider R a difficult language to learn?**  
I have a little experience with R from ST501/502, so I am not as blind as I was when I first learned SAS. So far, I do not find it to be difficult. To me, it is difficult because I am unfamiliar with it. Like Calculus! Calculus is not hard, you've just never seen anything like it before! *I think my former math teacher self is showing!*
