# ST 558 Project 1  
For this project, I was able to sharpen many of the skills that I have learned thus far in this class. 

## Outline of Project  
For my project, I have three parts. The first part discusses JSON data. The second is where I created and used the functions that were to retrieve the data. Third, I took the data and completed basic exploratory analysis on it. For each of the data sets, I performed at least one analysis and created at least one graphic. After I created the graphic, I briefly discussed what the graphic showed (if it showed anything).  

**JSON Data**  
If I am honest, I did not know what JSON Data was despite having downloaded JSON Data in a previous homework assignment. Now, I know what it is and how it is useful! The part that I struggled with the most was bringing in the data. I had an easier time connecting to the API, and downloading the JSON data. But parsing and querying the data was difficult. It took me a significant amount of time and research to realize that the JSON data is brought in as a list and I had to reference the $data part to get the data that I wanted. Within a lot of the JSON data sets, there were numerous variables to look at. At times, it was overwhelming. I tried to pick variables that would be helpful for analysis, but it was still a lot to look at. 

**Data Analysis**  
This part was not too difficult. For a few of my data sets, I had to create another variable or two to run some sort of data analysis. Specifically, I felt that I had to create a categorical variable or make another variable a factor to be able to run some contingency tables. A lot of the data seemed to be quantitative. I also struggled with choosing the correct was to analyze the data. (I will discuss this next.) Overall, the analysis gave me a lot of experience with ggplot; I am much more confident in my ability to work with data sets, create summaries, create graphs, etc.  

**What I Would Do Differently**  
There are definitely a few things I would do differently. I decided to run a small numeric analysis on each data set. I think it would have been a better use of my time, but also more comprehensive, if I instead did a lot of numeric analysis on one larger data set. The data sets were so large that I had to make smaller data sets to be able to run some sort of analysis. If I were to do the project again, I would focus on one data set. I would prefer to have known lots of things about one data set than one thing about many data sets. I am not sure if this could be changed, but I found the RMD file hard to work with. Please don't get me wrong; I do not mean that RMarkdown is hard. It is not hard at all. However, my RMarkdown file was so large that it was hard to keep track of where I was, or where I was working. I had organized it like it shows in the Table of Contents but when looking at the RMarkdown file, it was hard to keep track of which headings were for which parts. I wish there was a way to give page-breaks or the like within RMarkdown. Perhaps I could have been more organized.   

**Big Take-Aways**  
Overall, I am pleased with my project and thankful for the opportunity to work with many things that were unfamiliar. One of the biggest take-aways was knowing what and how to work with JSON Data. I learned a lot about it and why it is often used. This project also showed me how versatile RMarkdown is. What can't it do?
