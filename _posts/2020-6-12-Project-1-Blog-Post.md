# ST 558 Project 1  
For this project, I was able to sharpen many of the skills that I have learned thus far in this class. 

**JSON Data**  
If I am honest, I did not know what JSON Data was despite having downloaded JSON Data in a previous homework assignment. Now, I know what it is and how it is useful! The part that I struggled with the most was bringing in the data. I had an easier time connecting to the API, and downloading the JSON data. But parsing and querying the data was difficult. It took me a significant amount of time and research to realize that the JSON data is brought in as a list and I had to reference the $data part to get the data that I wanted. Within a lot of the JSON data sets, there were numerous variables to look at. At times, it was overwhelming. I tried to pick variables that would be helpful for analysis, but it was still a lot to look at. 

**Data Analysis**  
This part was not too difficult. For a few of my data sets, I had to create another variable or two to run some sort of data analysis. Specifically, I felt that I had to create a categorical variable or make another variable a factor to be able to run some contingency tables. A lot of the data seemed to be quantitative.
